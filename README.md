# league-predictions

The Javascript core logic for league standings predictions. 

The logic under src folder is written first and aims to be indipendent from the architecture. 
The eventual framework that will render and control the logic will be added as a plugin to the system. 
An example of such implementation with angularjs is located under the folder src/web.

Tests can be run with karma start karma.conf.js
